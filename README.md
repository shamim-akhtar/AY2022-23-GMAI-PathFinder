# GMAI PathFinder

Pathfinding is plotting the most optimal route between two points by a computer application. The most optimal path is usually associated with identifying the course that best meets the problemâ€™s objective. It could be finding the shortest, the cheapest, the fastest, or other criteria defined by the problem between two points in an extensive network of points.

In this tutorial, we create a pathfinder based on the A* algorithm, solve 2D grid-based pathfinding, and demonstrate the application in Unity.

> 
In this first tutorial, we create a generic pathfinder that is algorithm agnostic. Then we create three implementations of the pathfinder using the A*, Djikstra and Greedy best-first algorithm. We apply this generic pathfinder to various pathfinding problems (8-Puzzle, rectangular grid-based map and graph-based map).

>
In the second tutorial, we apply our generic pathfinder and solve the 8-puzzle problem and demonstrate the application in Unity.

In the third tutorial, we apply our generic pathfinder and solve the 2D grid-based pathfinding and demonstrate the application in Unity.
